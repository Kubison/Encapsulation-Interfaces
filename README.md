Encapsulation

--Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.

--As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.

--Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
